        <hr>
        <p>I recently graduated from the City University of New York's Queens College with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. 
            After completing an Associates Degree (Mathematics and Science) at Queensborough Community College, 
            I continued my education at Queens College, 
            where I was a member of the Transfer Honors Program, which recognizes extra-curricular and academic excellence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked as an cybersecurity research intern at US Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory where I 
            contributed to research on the resilience of critical infrastructure systems, creating simplified models of the 
            power grid. Specifically, I investigated the viability of the use of various procedural generation algorithms 
            in their use in generating models of the power grid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about introducing coding to others; as a student at QCC; I was an instructor for the NYS 
            Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP). In this role, I developed and taught a curriculum to underrepresented 
            and/or disadvantaged middle and high school students on robotics, using Scratch and Python. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was recipient of the CUNY Research Scholars Program scholarship, where under the mentorship of Dr.&nbspYusuf Dansiman, 
            I analyzed and optimized different cross validation techniques in their use in time-series datasets.
